# MyToken - Custom Cryptocurrency on Aptos

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

MyToken is a simple cryptocurrency implemented as a smart contract on the **Aptos blockchain** using the Move programming language.
It demonstrates how to create and manage a custom token using Aptosâ€™ `coin` standard library. The contract provides two core functions:

* **Token Creation**: Initializes the token with a name, symbol, decimals, and supply monitoring.
* **Minting**: Allows the creator to mint new tokens and deposit them into any recipientâ€™s account.

This project serves as a minimal yet practical example for beginners exploring Aptos smart contracts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision of the Project

The vision of MyToken is to provide a **lightweight, easy-to-understand, and extensible cryptocurrency template** for developers and learners on the Aptos ecosystem. It aims to reduce the complexity of token creation while showcasing the powerful features of Move for secure digital asset management.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

The current implementation is intentionally simple. In the future, MyToken can be extended with additional features, such as:

* **Burning tokens**: Allowing token holders to permanently remove tokens from circulation.
* **Transfer restrictions**: Implementing custom rules like lock-up periods or whitelisting.
* **Governance mechanisms**: Enabling community-driven decision-making for upgrades or token policies.
* **Staking and rewards**: Allowing users to stake MyToken and earn incentives.
* **Integration with DeFi platforms**: Expanding usability by connecting MyToken to decentralized exchanges and lending protocols.

This makes MyToken a strong foundation for building more advanced **DeFi applications** on Aptos.
